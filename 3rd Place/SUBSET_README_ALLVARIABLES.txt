GENERAL INFORMATION

Title of Dataset: A subset of the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) & the Mexican
Cognitive Aging Ancillary Study (Mex-Cog)

Abstract: MHAS was designed to prospectively evaluate the impact of disease on the health,
function, and mortality of adults over 50 in both urban and rural areas of Mexico. The
study's overall goal is to  examine the aging process and its disease and disability
burden in a large representative panel of older Mexicans, using a broad socioeconomic
perspective. Mex-Cog was an in-depth cognitive  assessment in a subsample of older adults
of the ongoing MHAS study. The Mex-Cog study provides in-depth cognitive data that
enhances the study of cognitive aging in two ways. First, linking to MHAS  longitudinal
data on cognition, health, genetics, biomarkers, economic resources, health care, family
arrangements, and psychosocial factors expands the scope of information on cognitive
impairment and  dementia among Mexican adults. Second, harmonization with other similar
studies around the globe  promotes cross-national studies on cognition with comparable
data. MHAS interviews were performed in 2001, 2003, 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2021, while Mex-
Cog's were in 2016 and 2021. We present a subset of MHAS variables and participants to
enable early detection of cognitive decline employing artificial  intelligence methods.
Our subset was extracted considering waves from 2001-2018 of MHAS and both waves  of Mex-
Cog.

Date of data collection:
    MHAS: 2001, 2003, 2012, 2015, 2018 & 2021
    Mex-Cog: 2016 & 2021
    MHAS subset: 2024

Geographic location of data collection: National Institute of Public Health in Mexico,
Mexico

Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data:  The first
phase of MHAS (waves 1 and 2) was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of
Health/National Institute on Aging [R01AG18016, B.J.S., PI]. The study was a collaborative
effort of researchers from the Universities of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin in the
USA and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografia e Informática (INEGI) in Mexico.
The second phase of MHAS (waves 3 and 4) is supported by the National Institutes of
Health/National Institute on Aging [R01AG018016, R.W., PI] and by the INEGI in Mexico. The
following waves were a collaborative effort from the University of Texas Medical Branch
(UTMB), the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI, Mexico), the University
of Wisconsin, the Instituto Nacional de Geriatría (INGer, Mexico) and the Instituto
Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP, Mexico). Mex-Cog received funding from NIA/NIH (grant R01
AG051158) and support from the WHO/PAHO Collaborating Center on Aging and Health at the
University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).

ABSTRACT: We propose to discover novel markers for early prediction of AD/ADRD using
artificial intelligence approaches, and a subset of the Mexican Health and Aging Study
(MHAS), & the Mexican Cognitive Aging Ancillary Study (Mex-Cog) database. This database
contains information on socioeconomic  conditions, marital status, fertility, unions or
marriages, family structure, including number of children and siblings (deceased and
living), parents living status and their education, weekly contact with family, money
transfer behaviors, and social and religious activities. Additionally, the database also
contains variables such as widowhood and its economic consequences, individual income,
assets, broad employment, pension history, type of housing, other indicators of housing
quality, property conditions, availability of consumer durables, self-reported health
conditions, a cognitive assessment, and anthropometric measurements and blood analysis for
a subsample of the data. From the harmonized MHAS dataset provided by Global2Aging we
selected ## variables out of the 1282 original ones. This selection process was performed
to reduce redundant variables or variables measured only in one or two waves. Using ML and
the proposed databases, we hope to discover non-biological markers impacting the Mexican
population.  Many of the variables present in the database are extensions of predictor
areas that are being studied as risk / protective factors for AD/ADRD, such as gut biome
(diet, hygiene, living conditions, housing quality, obesity), lack of neuroplasticity
(education, social interaction/isolation, family contact, living alone, hearing loss),
contribution of other health  issues including metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes,
dyslipidemia), lifestyle (smoking, alcohol), among others. To evaluate the impact of the
predictor variables on the development of AD/ADRD, the database contains MMSE and CSI’D
scores. Using these datasets and ML, we hope to establish such connections and identify
at-risk groups that have the potential to inform macro-level health strategies and
interventions in the U.S. for the 38 million Mexican Americans that go beyond the five
fingers of intervention: 1) healthy food, 2) physical activity, 3) mental stimulation, 4)
social activities and 5) monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors. Overall, the proposed
databases enable  the analysis of various types of risk factors and their possible
relationships. Since MHAS is part of the HRS International Family of Studies, and Mex-Cog
follows the  harmonized protocol for cognitive aging (HCAP), the models designed using
these databases can be easily extrapolated to studies following the same protocols.

BACKGROUND: In the U.S., non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults are
disproportionately more likely than White older adults to suffer from AD/ADRD. Data from
the Census Bureau and the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) study indicates that 19%
of Black and 14% of Hispanic adults age 65 and older have Alzheimer's dementia compared
with 10% of White older adults. However, most clinical research is performed with White
Americans. Data has suggested that Hispanic/Latino populations represent around 4.4% or
less of the total participation in some North American randomized controlled trials (RCT)
for Alzheimer's Disease. Comparatively, other studies have raised the concern of the
shrinking minority of enrolled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino populations in ARDR
clinical trials, with a cumulative 4.5% participation. Recent improvements in recruitment,
such as the 2022 Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease trial, increased Hispanic/Latino
enrollment to 12.4%; nevertheless, non-Hispanic Whites were still overrepresented with
approximately 76.9% of total enrollment. More concerning was the non-Hispanic Black
population, which had a mere 2.5% of total participation in the trial. Underrepresented
racial/ethnic communities are often ineligible after initial screenings and, therefore,
fail to be enrolled. Various factors contribute to enrollment failure, including
socioeconomic status, literacy, acculturation, stigma, discrimination, neighborhood health
metrics, language, and beliefs about dementia within these populations. This situation
raises concerns because the low representation of these communities limits understanding
of their specific risk factors for developing ADRD. Considering that Latinos are the
largest and fastest-growing minority in the United States, numbered 63 million in 2022,
with nearly 60% of Mexican origin it is important to develop models tailored to this
specific population. Additionally, utilizing survey-based data to identify and assess risk
factors for developing AD/ADRD enables the creation of high-reach tools. These tools would
permit the evaluation of a broad segment of the community concerning their potential to
develop AD/ADRD. Furthermore, this approach is particularly advantageous as it circumvents
the  high costs associated with imaging techniques such as MRI or CFS biomarkers analysis.
Consequently, it facilitates the evaluation of large societal groups at minimal costs.
Moreover, the amount of socioeconomic and demographic information contained within these
databases allows for identifying social and cultural factors that may influence the
development and progression of the disease, extending beyond the biological factors that
have been more extensively studied. Integrating both types of information—biological and
socio-demographic—enhances early detection capabilities by correlating risk factors with
early health variations. This statement means that, for individuals with certain socio-
demographic risk factors, minor health changes that might otherwise be considered normal
may indicate the disease's onset. Since brain changes can begin years before symptoms
arise, detecting these subtle health variations early on, combined with the discovered
risk factors, can justify imaging techniques for early detection of AD/ADRD. Moreover,
using this database enhances the understanding of AD/ADRD development within Hispanic
(Mexican) populations, a demographic group with a greater prevalence of these conditions
and yet underrepresented in United States healthcare research. The utilization of MHAS and
Mex-Cog databases offers a distinct advantage over sources like the Health and Retirement
Study, as it provides tailored insights into the unique epidemiological patterns of this
specific group. This strategic approach enriches the precision of the research and
highlights the commitment to inclusive representation in the study of AD/ADRD.

METHODS:

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: For MHAS -
https://www.mhasweb.org/Documentation/SurveyDesign.aspx, specifically in Methodological
Documents year 2001, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2021  For Mex-Cog -
https://www.mhasweb.org/Documentation/SurveyDesign.aspx, specifically Methodological
Documents year 2016, 2021.  Overall, the MHAS data was collected through face-to-face
interviews or from an informant in cases where the R wasn't able/available to
respond. The first two waves were performed using paper questionnaires, while later waves
used mobile devices. The Mex-Cog 2016 sample was selected using the MHAS wave 4 (2015) as
the sampling frame. The Mex-Cog contains three parts: Cognitive assessment, Adequate
Informant Survey, and Anthropometric and Performance Measures. The interviewers collected
most of the data using a laptop directly in the field, following the filters, jumps, and
qualifications specified in the questionnaire. Some cognitive tasks were collected using
paper and pencil as required, such as drawing, writing, or working on paper. These tasks
were later scored by two trained people who digitized the results  which were later added
to the final database.

Methods for processing the data:  To select the variables for the subset, our team
manually evaluated all the variables from the Harmonized MHAS codebook and eliminated
variables that were only present in up to two waves or that were redundant, always keeping
the one with more detailed information. We create a file named mhas_variables.txt with the
selected ones.

We downloaded the MHAS and Mex-Cog's .dta files  from the MHAS website and loaded them
into the STATA software to obtain the final dataset. Directly from this software, two .CSV
files were exported and loaded into Python through the pandas library. Even though the
.dta file can be opened through pandas in Python, we converted the format to reduce the
possibility of losing information on the missing flags used by the researchers to identify
specific reasons for missing data. In the MHAS data, we delete all the non-selected
variables using pandas and create two new variables to harmonize some information between
waves, following the MHAS codebook instructions.  From the Mex-Cog raw data, we extracted
MMSE performance and computed the CSI'D score following the instructions in the 2016 Mex-
Cog harmonization codebook. We used the raw data so we could perform the same processing
on 2016 and 2021 cognition information since the 2021 data has yet to be harmonized by
G2AGING. To extract the subset of participants that are in both MHAS and Mex-Cog, we used
the 'unhhidnp' variable in MHAS and 'cunicah'+'np' in Mex-Cog. Finally, we create two
files, the first consisting of the selected MHAS variables for the participants in both
MHAS and Mex-Cog, and the second, their respective cognitive scores for 2016 and 2021.

Regarding the harmonization process of MHAS: The Global to Aging team was in charge of
processing the raw data for MHAS and Mex-Cog. The "Harmonized MHAS Documentation"  file
states the following:
"In order to make the data more accessible to researchers and to facilitate such
comparisons, we, the USC Gateway to Global Aging Data team, created the Harmonized
MHAS, a user-friendly version of a subset of the MHAS Interviews. The Harmonized MHAS
initiative is part of a larger set of projects. With funding and support from the
National Institute on Aging, we have also created the Harmonized HRS (United States),
Harmonized ELSA (England), Harmonized SHARE (Europe + Israel),Harmonized CRELES
(Costa Rica), Harmonized KLoSA (South Korea), Harmonized JSTAR (Japan), Harmonized
TILDA (Ireland), Harmonized CHARLS (China), Harmonized MARS (Malaysia), and Harmonized
LASI (India) data. Further information about these Harmonized data files with
questionnaires and other metadata is available on our searchable website,
https://g2aging.org/. In creating the Harmonized data files, we have followed the RAND
HRS and Harmonized HRS conventions of variable naming and data structure. The RAND HRS
is a user-friendly version of a subset of the HRS that the RAND Center for the Study
of Aging created to increase usability. The Harmonized HRS is a supplementary dataset
to the RAND HRS, which also includes a subset of the HRS data, that the Gateway to Global
Aging Data team has created to increase usability of a greater number of HRS
variables. The Harmonized MHAS includes variables with a similar naming convention
that mimics the RAND HRS, Harmonized HRS, and other Harmonized variables. This
document describes these data. Note, however, that MHAS license agreements do not
allow us to disseminate the data directly. Instead, MHAS distributes the Harmonized
MHAS dataset. We also make available a Stata script (".do file") that generates these
derived variables from the original MHAS data files."

    Codes used to create the harmonized versions of the data can be found in:
https://www.mhasweb.org/DataProducts/HarmonizedData.aspx under 'STATA creation code'.

Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:  Eventhough the
.dta file can be opened through pandas in python, we recommend converting to a csv from
the STATA software to reduce the posibilities of losing information on the missing flags
used by the researchers to identify specific reasons of missing data. Once the organizers
of the challenge have registered in the MHAS website, we can send the exported csv files
if they don't have access to STATA software. The csv files can be loaded in python >=3.7
and the corresponding pandas version for the python being used.

Standards and calibration information, if appropriate:

Environmental/experimental conditions: The MHAS surveys were completed through direct
interviews or proxy interviews in cases  of illness, hospitalization, or temporary absence
of the interviewed. The 2001 and 2003 interviews were conducted using paper and pencil;
from 2012 on, the interviews were completed using Computer Assisted Personal Interview
(CAPI). For both Mex-Cog waves, most of each survey was completed using CAPI; however,
paper and pencil were employed for specific cognitive exercises.

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: The MHAS and Mex-Cog
datasets have been verified and harmonized under the Global to Aging team, which is funded
by the National Institute of Aging. The team developed  a platform to share and centralize
the access to longitudinal aging and cognitive studies which have undergone rigorous
harmonization and imputation from the raw studies' data. The principal investigators and
collaborators belong to many renowned institutions like the University of Southern
California, University of Michigan, Trinity  College Dublin, among others. This
multidisciplinary and large team also supports a good quality standard in the published
data.

Specifically, for Mex-Cog: "To examine validity, we followed Messick’s [31] approach
endorsed by the American Educational Research Association and the American Psychological
Association [32], based on the validity of the inferences made from scores. For the Mex-
Cog cognitive instrument, the underlying constructs are cognitive status and, more
specifically, cognitive domain status inferred from scores. For the informant’s
questionnaire, cognitive status and cognitive  deterioration processes are the underlying
constructs inferred from the answers given by the informants. We analyzed four of the five
sources of validity proposed by Messick [33, 34]: 1) content, 2) response process, 3)
internal structure, and 4) relationship with other variables. The fourth source of
validity, consequences of the assessment, does not apply given the cross-sectional design
of the Mex-Cog study." More details can be found in section 4. Validity Analysis of the
